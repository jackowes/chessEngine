# Jackson and Ryan's Chess Engine

We're building a Python-based chess engine. We plan on building simpler chess engines before moving on to more complicated and powerful engines.

Here are our current plans:
- Create engine that plays random moves COMPLETED
- Create a working web chess GUI
- Allow user-specified chess engines to play
- Create engine that uses minimax algorithm
- Add alpha-beta pruning to minimax algorithm
- Create engine that uses a neural network
